## Introduction

Dear CAT Reloaded Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Abdelrahman Elaref, and I am very excited about the opportunity to join CAT Reloaded. However, due to my current schedule, I am facing some time constraints.

I am currently preparing for my finals and studying other courses along with some personal projects. Given this situation, I am finding it challenging to complete the task required for the process within the given timeframe.

As an alternative, I would like to share some links to my previous work, which I believe demonstrate my skills and dedication:

- [ETL with Python and PowerBI](https://github.com/AED7M/ETL-Python-PowerBI)
- [Sales Performance Analysis Report](https://github.com/AED7M/Sales-Performance-Analysis-Report)
- [Gemstone Price Prediction](https://github.com/AED7M/gemstone-price-prediction)

I hope these examples give you a good sense of my skills. If it's possible to consider my application based on this work, I would greatly appreciate it. If not, I will do my best to complete the task, but I wanted to be upfront about my current situation.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,  
Abdelrahman

## Notes
